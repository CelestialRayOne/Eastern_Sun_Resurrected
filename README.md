# Eastern Sun Resurrected
Eastern Sun Resurrected is an individual effort to extend the port that tireheb and bonesy made for the classic eastern sun mod (this is a fork from bonesy's repository). This enhancement will be long term and will include almost everything: skill reworks, class rebalance, increased difficulty, new content, new recipes etc.

There is no end in sight for the support of this mod unless announced otherwise.

# Installation Guide
You need to download D2Launch for the best experience, which can be found here: https://www.d2rmodding.com/modtools

Once you have installed D2Launch, click on download new mod and choose Eastern Sun Resurrected from the dropdown then press Install Mod. Once the mod is installed, click on Home on the left menu to refresh D2launch, Eastern Sun Resurrected should appear as a mod choice in the home dropdown. Press play mod and enjoy.

When new updates are released, you'll be able to click on Check for Mod Updates and this will update the mod automatically.

# Changelogs
You can view changelogs [here](https://celestialrayone.github.io/Eastern_Sun_Resurrected/docs/index.html). This is also a link to the mod's documentation.

# Disclaimer
Since this is an ongoing beta and since I have limited experience with modding diablo 2, I strongly suggest you use the periodic Auto-Backup Characters option from D2Launch (Options -> QoL Options), such that if I release a broken version, you can always recover corrupted save files.

# Road Map
### Character balance
   The originally planned changes for the characters have mostly been achieved, but more changes will come in the future to keep the things fresh.
### Difficulty overhaul
   The campaign difficulty has been overhauled. Some things might change in the future to make certain zones more difficult or to keep the leveling experience fresh.
### New content
   A brand-new endgame system has been introduced through itemized maps that open portals to challenging zones. Face deadly new uber encounters and regular enemies, and uncover an all-new tier of mythical uniquesâ€”designed to enhance, redefine, or completely transform your playstyle.
### Bug fixes
   This will be an ongoing process. I will fix bugs as I find them. It's possible some bugs will never be fixed (mostly due to my lack of modding knowledge or perhaps engine limitations).
### What now?
   More content and changes are planned, such as skill changes, new enemies, new endgame maps, new uber encounters, new recipes and items etc.

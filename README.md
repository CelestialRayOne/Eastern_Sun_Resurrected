# Eastern Sun Resurrected
Eastern Sun Resurrected is an individual effort to extend the port that tireheb and bonesy made for the classic eastern sun mod (this is a fork from bonesy's repository). This enhancement will be long term and will include almost everything: skill reworks, class rebalance, increased difficulty, new content, new recipes etc.

This eastern sun version will be a long, ongoing project and I'll probably be the only one working on it. I have limited modding knowledge as this is the first time I'm modding diablo 2. The good part is that I have a lot of experience with arpgs in general, which will help a lot with balancing and mechanics.

# Installation Guide
You need to download D2Launch for the best experience, which can be found here: https://www.d2rmodding.com/modtools

Once you have installed D2Launch, click on download new mod and choose Eastern Sun Resurrected from the dropdown then press Install Mod. Once the mod is installed, click on Home on the left menu to refresh D2launch, Eastern Sun Resurrected should appear as a mod choice in the home dropdown. Press play mod and enjoy.

When new updates are released, you'll be able to click on Check for Mod Updates and this will update the mod automatically.

# Changelogs
You can view changelogs [here](https://celestialrayone.github.io/Eastern_Sun_Resurrected/docs/index.html). This is also a link to the mod's documentation.

# Disclaimer
Since this is an ongoing beta and since I have limited experience with modding diablo 2, I strongly suggest you use the periodic Auto-Backup Characters option from D2Launch (Options -> QoL Options), such that if I release a broken version, you can always recover corrupted save files.

# Road Map
### Character balance - DONE
   The characters are mostly done, but this will be an ongoing process of continuous skill balance and fixes to keep the game fresh and fair.
### Difficulty overhaul - DONE
   The difficulty has been overhauled. Small changes may come along the way, but there's nothing major planned for the campaign.
### New content - DONE
   The new endgame system is complete. There are several new zones that can be accessed through map items that drop from endgame enemies. The new maps include several new bosses with unique mechanics, you can find a new series of mythical uniques with build defining properties and new cube regents as well.
### Bug fixes
   This will be an ongoing process. I will fix bugs as I find them. It's possible some bugs will never be fixed (mostly due to my lack of modding knowledge or perhaps engine limitations).
### What now?
   I will continue to rework skills, add new content, new items, new recipes etc.

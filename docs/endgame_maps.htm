							<font color="red">Warning:</font> endgame map zones are much more difficult than all
							other content they require extremely well defined builds.<br>
							Endgame map zones can be accessed by transmuting map items by themselves in <font
								color="red"> act 5 hell</font>. There are a total of 18 map
							items across 5 tiers.<br>
							Each tier has 4 different map zones, except tier 5 which has only 2 maps with unique and
							extremely difficult boss encounters.<br>
							Map items can drop from nihlathak domain superuniques. Each superunique boss has a 5%
							chance to drop a tier 1 map.<br>
							Map items can also drop from champions and unique monsters in level 96 terrorized zones.<br>
							Map items can also be acquired as a rare drop in endgame map zones themselves, which
							will be your main source if you run map zones regularly<br>
							Regular monsters in maps can drop a map one tier higher than the map tier they're killed in.
							You can also upgrade maps at a 3:1 ratio.<br>
							It is recommended that your build has at least 5k hp, max resistances, some physical
							resist and other defensive layers in order to survive.<br>
							Rewards that are expressed in average chance mean that those rewards can be increased by up
							to 100% at players 8. For example, An ancient has 50% chance to roll a key drop
							<b>twice</b>,
							so on average you get one key, but increasing player number to 8 will make him have almost
							100% chance to drop 2 keys.<br>
							Endgame maps can become terrorized and one map of each tier will be terrorized at one time
							(except tier 5, which are terrorized both at the same time, independent of others).<br>
							Endgame maps can be terrorized on normal and nightmare difficulties too, but it is not
							intended. This cannot be fixed due to engine limitations.<br>
							Terrorized bosses always drop a Worldstone Shard (except tier 5 bosses due to an engine
							limitation).<br>
							<storng>Tier 1-4 bosses</storng> have an <font color="purple">Immunity Shield</font> that
							falls off from time to time. You can make it fall more often with resistance reduction
							effects.

								hatred
								is not so easily destroyed. Deep within the smoldering veins of Hell, where the echoes
								of suffering never fade, the
								remnants of Mephisto's essence festered. Though his prison was broken, his malice
								endured, clinging to the very fabric of Hell itself. Every whisper of betrayal, every
								act of cruelty, every drop of innocent blood spilled upon the earth fed his lingering
								presence, reforging his spirit in the shadows. From the smoldering abyss, he rose anew.
								No longer bound to a soulstone, no longer constrained by the laws of the past - Mephisto
								had returned and is more powerful than ever before.</i><br><br>
							<font color="red">Invincibility</font> - As his name states, Mephisto is completely

							<font color="red">Flurry of Charged Bolts</font> - Roughly every 12 seconds, Mephisto will
							cast a flurry of charged bolts that seek nearby enemies, dealing very high lightning
							damage.<br>
							<font color="red">Flurry of Ice Orbs</font> - When approaching Mephisto, he will attempt to
							cast on a 12 seconds cooldown a flurry of ice orbs that deal insane amounts of cold and
							physical damage. The ice orbs don't stop after one hit, but rather attempt to seek and hit
							their target multiple times, so it is imperative to run away from this spell.<br>
							<font color="red">Cold Wave Prison</font> - Mephisto will rarely cast 4 waves of cold,
							converging on top of the unsuspecting players and dealing extremely high cold damage to
							anyone in their path.<br>
							<font color="red">Passives</font> - Mephisto pierces 100% of your elemental resistances.<br>
							<font color="green">Heaven's Light</font> - Not all hope is lost when fighting Mephisto.
							Very rarely after damaging Mephisto, the lights of heaven will scatter the battlefield.
							Picking up a orb of light empowers you, making you and any summons affected able to damage

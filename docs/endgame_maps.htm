							<font color="red">Warning:</font> endgame map zones are much more difficult than all
							other content they require extremely well defined builds.<br>
							Endgame map zones can be accessed by transmuting map items by themselves in <font
								color="red"> act 5 hell</font>. There are a total of 18 map
							items across 5 tiers.<br>
							Each tier has 4 different map zones, except tier 5 which has only 2 maps with unique and
							extremely difficult boss encounters.<br>
							Map items can drop from nihlathak domain superuniques. Each superunique boss has a 5%
							chance to drop a tier 1 map.<br>
							Map items can also drop from champions and unique monsters in level 96 terrorized zones.<br>
							Map items can also be acquired as a rare drop in endgame map zones themselves, which
							will be your main source if you run map zones regularly<br>
							Regular monsters in maps can drop a map one tier higher than the map tier they're killed in.
							You can also upgrade maps at a 3:1 ratio.<br>
							It is recommended that your build has at least 5k hp, max resistances, some physical
							resist and other defensive layers in order to survive.<br>
							Rewards that are expressed in average chance mean that those rewards can be increased by up
							to 100% at players 8. For example, An ancient has 50% chance to roll a key drop
							<b>twice</b>,
							so on average you get one key, but increasing player number to 8 will make him have almost
							100% chance to drop 2 keys.<br>
							Endgame maps can become terrorized and one map of each tier will be terrorized at one time
							(except tier 5, which are terrorized both at the same time, independent of others).<br>
							Endgame maps can be terrorized on normal and nightmare difficulties too, but it is not
							intended. This cannot be fixed due to engine limitations.<br>
							Terrorized bosses always drop a Worldstone Shard (except tier 5 bosses due to an engine
							limitation).<br>
							<storng>Tier 1-4 bosses</storng> have an <font color="purple">Immunity Shield</font> that
							falls off from time to time. You can make it fall more often with resistance reduction
							effects.
